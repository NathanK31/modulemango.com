            <p>
                These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between
                you ("User," "you," or "your") and Module Mango ("Company," "we," "our," or "us")
                governing your access to and use of our mobile applications (collectively, the "Apps")
                available on Google Play Store and other platforms.

                    <strong>Price Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to change prices for in-app
                    purchases and subscriptions. Price changes for subscriptions will take effect at
                    the start of the next billing period following notice.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For subscription-based Apps, the specific terms, pricing, and billing frequency will
                be clearly displayed before purchase.
            </p>

            <h2>User Content</h2>

                    to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, and distribute your User
                    Content in connection with operating and improving our Apps
                </li>
                <li>
                    The right to remove or disable access to any User Content that violates these
                    Terms or applicable laws
                </li>
            </ul>

                consent to automatic updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any App or feature at any

                discontinuation of our Apps.
            </p>

            <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>OUR APPS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
                EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement</li>
                <li>Warranties that our Apps will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of viruses</li>
                <li>Warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any content</li>
                <li>Warranties that our Apps will meet your specific requirements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the
                above exclusions may not apply to you.
            </p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MODULE MANGO AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
                EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages</li>
                <li>Any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses</li>
                <li>Any damages resulting from your use or inability to use our Apps</li>
                <li>Any unauthorized access to or alteration of your data</li>
                <li>Any conduct or content of third parties on our Apps</li>
                <li>Any content obtained from our Apps</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In no event shall our total liability exceed the amount you paid us (if any) in the
                twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or $100 USD, whichever is greater.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on liability, so some of the above
                limitations may not apply to you.
            </p>

            <h2>Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
                You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Module Mango and its officers,
                directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and licensors from and against any claims,
                liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
                arising out of or relating to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your use of our Apps</li>
                <li>Your User Content</li>
                <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>

                <li>Your violation of any applicable laws or regulations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms are effective until terminated. We may terminate or suspend your access
                to our Apps immediately, without prior notice or liability, if:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You breach any provision of these Terms</li>
                <li>We are required to do so by law</li>
                <li>We decide to discontinue our Apps</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Upon termination, your right to use our Apps will cease immediately. You may also
                terminate by uninstalling our Apps and discontinuing use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following sections survive termination: Intellectual Property Rights, User Content
                (license grants), Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, and Governing Law.
            </p>

            <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
                jurisdiction in which Module Mango operates, without regard to conflict of law principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of our Apps shall be resolved through
                good faith negotiations. If negotiations fail, disputes shall be resolved through binding
                arbitration or in the courts of competent jurisdiction, at our discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree to waive any right to participate in class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration.
            </p>

            <h2>Severability</h2>
            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
                shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, or if modification
                is not possible, it shall be severed. The remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
            </p>

            <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any App-specific terms, constitute
                the entire agreement between you and Module Mango regarding the use of our Apps and
                supersede any prior agreements.
            </p>

            <h2>Waiver</h2>
            <p>
                Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a
                waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by us.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material
                changes by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Posting the updated Terms on this page</li>
                <li>Updating the "Last updated" date</li>
                <li>Providing notice through our Apps (for significant changes)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Your continued use of our Apps after changes become effective constitutes acceptance
                of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using our Apps.
            </p>
