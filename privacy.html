            </p>
            <p>
                If any of our Apps are designed for use by children, they will comply with the
                Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Google Play's Families Policy,
                and will have a separate, specific privacy policy.
            </p>

                different from the laws of your country.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using our Apps, you consent to the transfer of your information to countries
                outside your country of residence. We take appropriate safeguards to ensure that
